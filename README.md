AI-Driven Crop Disease Detection
This project aims to leverage artificial intelligence to identify and classify crop diseases from images, helping farmers take timely preventive measures and improve agricultural outcomes.

🚀 Features
Automated Disease Detection: Classifies crop diseases from uploaded images with high accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple, intuitive interface for farmers and researchers.
Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle diverse datasets for global adaptability.
Insights and Recommendations: Provides actionable advice for disease management.


🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Python(streamlit), HTML5, CSS3
Backend: Python
AI/ML: TensorFlow/Keras, Python
Cloud Services: Streamlit cloud service

📊 Dataset
The project uses a publicly(Kaggle.com) available dataset of crop images labeled with disease types. Preprocessing steps include resizing, augmentation, and normalization.
